"""Carbon Voice platform adapter for Hermes Agent.

Architecture:
    Hermes  <──Socket.IO (primary)──   api.carbonvoice.app
    Hermes  ── REST poll fallback ──>  /v3/messages/recent
    Hermes  ── POST /v3/messages/start ──>  outbound replies

This module is the thin orchestrator that wires together:

    parse        — payload-shape helpers (pure)
    api          — REST client (CarbonVoiceAPI)
    transport    — Socket.IO + polling lifecycle (Transport)
    state        — disk-persisted cursor (Cursor)
    dedupe       — in-memory seen-message TTL cache (SeenCache)
    reactions    — visual ack on inbound (ReactionService)
    channels     — chat_type ("dm"/"group") + participant roster cache
    audit        — allowlist gate + ignored-sender audit log

No public webhook is required — the adapter holds an outbound Socket.IO
connection and polls /v3/messages/recent as a fallback. Cursor state is
persisted to disk so messages received while Hermes was offline are
processed on the next startup.

    # ── Thread-context fetch (PR 4) ──────────────────────────────────────
    #
    # When the agent gets @mentioned in a group thread for the first time
    # (no Hermes session yet for that thread), we have no history to feed
    # the LLM — it sees one isolated message and has to guess at context.
    # We fetch the thread's prior messages via CV's REST API and prepend
    # them as a ``[Thread context …]`` block to the user's message so
    # the agent has the prior history from turn 1.
    #
    # The "no active session" guard means this only fires on the first
    # turn in any given thread; every subsequent turn rides on the session
    # history that Hermes core maintains in SQLite, so there is no
    # duplication.
    #
    # CV has no native "list messages in thread" endpoint today, so we
    # combine two calls — a lightweight channel index (just ids +
    # ``parent_message_id``) plus a batched ``by-ids`` fetch — to assemble
    # the thread's transcript. When cv-api adds a direct thread-listing
    # endpoint the workaround collapses to one call; see
    # ``api.list_channel_message_index`` for the full rationale.
